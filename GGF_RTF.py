Program name: 
 GGF_RTF.py

Program objectives:
 This program reads in regression model coefficients produced by program 
 GGF_Training_Model.py, and real time solar wind data from a Met Office API, 
 and produces a an approximately one-hour forecast of the ground external 
 (i.e. excluding the internal field contribution) geomagnetic field (GGF) 
 at the three UK magnetometer stations operated by the British Geological 
 Survey: Eskdalemuir, Hartland and Lerwick. The forecast is given as the max, 
 min and mean of a 100-model ensemble at each time-step, where the 100 models 
 are obtained by training on 100 random samples of 80% of a database of 
 geomagnetic storm periods.

Input data requirements: 
 - GGF_Training_Model_Dataset_of_Stored_Model_Coefficients.pkl
    - Description: regression model coefficients relating the solar wind 
      epsilon parameter to the ground geomagnetic variation. These are used by 
      the ground geomagnetic prediction model in this program.
    - Source: produced by program 'GGF_Training_Model.py'.
    - Is it included here: yes. These data do not need to be reproduced 
      because the file is provided in the same directory as this program.
    - Format: a Python list containing a 5-dimensional numpy array of model 
      coefficients. The dimensions are: [stations, local time bins, magnetic 
      components, model parameters, randomised training data instances]. The 
      details of each dimension is as follows.
       - There are three stations (i.e. observatories) in the order: 
         Eskdalemuir, Hartland, Lerwick.
       - There are 24 local time bins, which are spaced at 1 hour intervals 
         with a 3-hour width for each bin. The first bin has a centroid at 
         00:30 local time, and spans the three hours from 23:00 to 02:00 local 
         time.
       - The three magnetic components have the order: x, y, z.
       - There are 6 model parameters which are used to solve for an estimate 
         of the ground geomagnetic variation (y) for a given magnetic component
         at a given station at a given local time. The equation being solved is 
         y = a + b*(sin(DOY)) + c*(cos(DOY)) + d*epsilon + e*(sin(DOY) * epsilon) + f*(cos(DOY) * epsilon)
         where a is the intercept coefficient, and the other coefficients 
         describe the effect of the following parameters: b for sine of day of 
         year (DOY), c for cosine of DOY, d for epsilon, e for 
         (sine of DOY)*epsilon, and f for (cosine of DOY)*epsilon.
       - There are 100 randomised training data instances, each of which 
         relates to a different random selection of 80% of the full set of 
         geomagnetic storm intervals used to train the model.
 - n4-key.txt
    - Description: the access key for the Met Office API used to access real 
      time solar wind data.
    - Source: Met Office, pers. comm.
    - Is it included here: yes.
    - Format: ascii text file contianing the API key as a single string.
 - substorm_model_solar_wind_weights_mean_std.json
    - Description: a file of the mean and standard deviations of the OMNI solar
      wind data from 1996-01-01 to 2014-12-31, for the solar wind parameters 
      used to train the substorm onset likelihood forecast model. The same mean
      and standard deviation information is used in this program to normalise 
      the real-time solar wind dtaa obtained from the API, before it is used to 
      produce the substorm onset likelihood prediction.
    - Source: this is a JSON-formatted copy of the values in the file 
      'omn_mean_std.npy', which is produced by program 
      'Substorm_Training_Model.py' and is stored in the directory 
      'Substorm/data'.
    - Is it included here: yes. These data do not need to be reproduced 
      because the file is provided in the same directory as this program.
    - Format: JSON format, with 10 data rows of alternating mean and standard 
      deviation values for the following parameters in order, where all 
      components relate to the GSM frame: IMF Bx, IMF By, IMF Bz, solar wind 
      x-component velocity, proton density. The magnetic components have units 
      of nanoTesla, the velocity has units of metres per second, and the proton
      density has units of n/cc.
 - substorm_model_coefficient_weights.epoch_200.val_loss_0.58.val_accuracy_0.70.hdf5
    - Description: the model coefficients used to forecast substorm onset from 
      solar wind data, trained by a convolutional neural network model.
    - Source: produced by program 'Substorm_Training_Model.py'. This is a 
      renamed copy of the coefficients file in directory 
      'Substorm/trained_model'.
    - Is it included here: yes. These data do not need to be reproduced 
      because the file is provided in the same directory as this program.
    - Format: Hierarchical Data Format HDF5.
 - Access to the Met Office API at 
   'https://gateway.api-management.metoffice.cloud/swx_swimmr_n4/1.0/', to 
   import real time solar wind observations from the L1 Lagrange point and 
   ground geomagnetic observations from the UK's three geomagnetic 
   observatories operated by the British Geological Survey.

Outputs: these are each in directory 'Forecast/Temp_storage_for_output_GGF_forecast':
 - real_time_magnetic_field_forecast_from_program_GGF_RTF_version_BRTFv2p3.dat
    - Description: an ascii-formatted text file of the forecast 
      values from the regression model ensemble (for the ground geomagnetic 
      perturbation) and the convolutional neural network model (for the 
      substorm onset likelihood). The forecast values extend about one hour
      into the future (the exact forecast span is dynamic and depends on the 
      solar wind speed).
    - Source: made by program GGF_RTF.py.
    - Format: the column format is as follows: [Day-Month-Year,  Hour:Minute,  
      Model Type Flag,  Substorm onset probability, Esk x mean,  Esk y mean,  
      Esk z mean,  Had x mean,  Had y mean,  Had z mean,  Ler x mean,  
      Ler y mean,  Ler z mean,  Esk x min,   Esk y min,   Esk z min,  
      Had x min,   Had y min,   Had z min,   Ler x min,   Ler y min,  
      Ler z min,   Esk x max,   Esk y max,   Esk z max,   Had x max,   
      Had y max,   Had z max,   Ler x max,   Ler y max,   Ler z max], where
      'Esk' is the observatory Eskdalemuir, 'Har' is Hartland, 'Ler' is 
      Lerwick, 'x','y','z' are the ground geomagnetic field perturbation 
      components, 'mean' is the mean value of the 100 model ensemble at a given 
      epoch, and likewise for 'max' and 'min'. The Model Type Flag has the 
      following meanings. 0: no problems: model forecast is based on the 
      epsilon coupling function. 1: some parts of the solar wind data were not 
      available for this epoch of the real-time solar wind stream, so the 
      forecast is based on interpolated values. 2: there were no solar wind 
      data at this epoch, so the output is nan. The substorm onset probability 
      defines the onset likelihood (from 0 to 1, with 1 the most likely), for 
      the hour after the model run time. Hence, the onset forecast is only 
      valid for that hour: the output file has nan values for onset 
      probabilities at forecast epochs greater than [current time + 60 mins].

Instructions for running this program:
 This program can be run on any machine with internet access. This is required
 for downloading the real-time API data. Optionally, the program can also be 
 run in a virtual environment using Docker (instructions below) -- in this 
 case, internet access is required to import the code files from a github 
 repository. Before running, the user should set the 'in_docker' flag to True 
 or False, dependent on whether the program is being run in Docker. If running 
 locally, the user should manually set the variable 'WORKDIR', dependent on 
 where the code is stored. If running on a BAS machine, the code is in this 
 directory: /data/psdcomplexity/eimf/SAGE_Model_Handover/Forecast.

Instructions for running in Docker:
 - Install Docker on the local machine.
 - Set the 'in_docker' flag in the code below to True.
 - The Dockerfile can then be run using the following commands:
    - docker builder prune -a (to remove previous cloned github repositories and make room for newer ones)
    - docker build -f [on the local machine, the directory and filename of the Dockerfile stored here in Forecast/Dockerfile] -t ggf_image . (to build the image)
    - docker run --name ggf_container ggf_image GGF_RTF.py (to run the Python script 'GGF_RTF.py' from the image in a container)
    - docker cp ggf_container:/root/run_environment/Temp_storage_for_output_GGF_forecast/ [on the local machine, the directory where you wish the output of the Python script to be copied to] (this copies the output forecast from a location in the Docker container to somewhere else on the local machine)
